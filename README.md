# Python Learning Journey

This repository documents a learning journey through Python, with a collection of simple scripts and exercises organized by week. It's intended as a personal roadmap and a practical showcase of fundamental programming concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each representing a week of study:

-   `semana1/`: Contains introductory scripts covering basic concepts like I/O, loops, and simple data manipulation.
-   `semana2/`: Focuses on functions, modularity, and building a simple menu-driven application.

## Content Details

### Week 1 (`semana1/`)

This week's scripts cover the basics of Python programming.

-   `hello.py`: A classic "Hello, World!" program that also prints the current date.
-   `calculator.py`: A simple script that takes two numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations (sum, subtraction, multiplication, division, average).
-   `areas.py`: Calculates the area of a circle, triangle, or rectangle based on user input.
-   `basic_loops.py`: Demonstrates `while` and `for` loops.
-   `list_strings.py`: Shows how to work with lists and perform basic string manipulations.
-   `sum_avarage.py`: Calculates the sum and average of a series of numbers from the user.
-   `sum_avarage_min_max.py`: Extends the previous script to also find the minimum and maximum values.
-   `agenda.py`: A simple command-line contact book.
-   `semana1.py`: An introductory script that greets the user and shows a simple loop.

### Week 2 (`semana2/`)

This week introduces the concept of functions and code organization.

-   `function.py`: A module containing a set of reusable utility functions for greeting, arithmetic, and list operations.
-   `main.py`: A menu-driven application that uses the functions from `function.py` to perform calculations based on user choices.

## How to Use

Each Python script (`.py`) can be run directly from the command line.

1.  **Navigate to a directory**:
    ```bash
    cd semana1
    ```
2.  **Run a script**:
    ```bash
    python3 <script_name>.py
    ```
    For example:
    ```bash
    python3 calculator.py
    ```

## Dependencies

The scripts in this repository use standard Python 3 libraries, so no special installation of external packages is required. Just ensure you have a working Python 3 environment.
